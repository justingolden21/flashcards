	todo:

add popovers

when flipping card, focus text area for instant typing

	bugs:

when changing the order of cards then deleting one, the following card's buttons won't work

	features:

import, export, and print flashcards

add option for spellcheck

group cards into folders

add option for flip to focus textarea or flip btn

checkbox to add quick copy buttons

add images to flashcard? how to export? must be hosted online?

toggle between sortable and draggable:
	$('#flashcards').sortable();
	$('.flashcard').draggable();
	problem is newly created cards won't be draggable, must call the code again after the DOM element is created, which isn't necessarily after we add the card. need timeout or callback

implement jquery ui "selectable"? in order to quickly delete or modify?
